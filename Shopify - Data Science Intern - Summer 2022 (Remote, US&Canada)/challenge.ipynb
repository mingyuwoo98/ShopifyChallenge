    "On Shopify, we have exactly 100 sneaker shops, and each of these shops sells only one model of shoe. We want to do some analysis of the average order value (AOV). When we look at orders data over a 30 day window, we naively calculate an AOV of $3145.13. Given that we know these shops are selling sneakers, a relatively affordable item, something seems wrong with our analysis. \n",

If a store is doing extremely well, it is a good sign to keep the store up and potentially think of ways to further boost the popularity of said store. If a store is doing poorly, more attention should be brought to that store to see what the root cause is. The AOC metric does not clearly show the impact of individual stores as it is a single number that represents 100 stores and the fact that it is an average. The average metric has a tendency to do poorly when outliers exist (hence it is not a robust metric). The best metric would be to find the AOC per UNIQUE STORE. Especially in this unique case, outliers will not exist within each store since they only sell a single pair of sneakers.\n",
